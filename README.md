Playing with your band is fun, and it would be useful to listen to yourself in an easy way. Just recording everything takes hours to find where a song starts, where it ends...
You know.
Now, everything is easier! Plug everything, start jack, and play! When you stop playing a song, you can tab on your phone/tablet/eBook reader, click your mouse or run a command on the terminal, and you are done!
The *previous* played song got saved and (if needed) converted to a file. If needed, it creates a Non Session from it.
